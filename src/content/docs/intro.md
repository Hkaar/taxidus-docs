# Hey there!

Welcome to the start of the documentation that describes and lays out Taxidus
for you as a developer or maybe your a curious user that likes poking around in random places.

Well let's get started shall we?

## What you'll be learning or reading

1. Core concepts on how Taxidus is designed and built
2. The components to build the system that Taxidus uses
3. The design of the custom `Lua` engine that Taxidus uses
4. The structure of the API that Taxidus core provides,

That's it right, nothing more and simple than ever before!

Now go on then, start reading through the rest of the documentation
